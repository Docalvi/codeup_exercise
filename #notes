class= "top-navigation"

Components elements thar are used though out the project
it can appear on a page more than once
when you classify something its telling the code that not all parts of the compnent are the same
for this reason we have different selectors most common selector is classes "class"
ex:
.top_navigation{
font-weight: bold

}
when you do this the style will cascade onto everything with the anchor tag of top navigation

when selecting an idea for style it must start with a # in order to properly identify what youre trying to change


which selector is more important
1. IDs
2. classes
3. elements

handy tool press shift option and then click with your cursor to type in multiple places


an element can have more than one class to do this in an html project you have to use a space in between the classes

for pseudo selectors you have to use the correct order or else the the selectors will not follow the rules and your code
will look funky
 always remember to use "LoVe HAte"

try not to use inline style when styling your project

you should create another file with your style assets and link your project to that file.
 when coding try not to repeat yourself its bad practice to have multiple repeating code

 inline styles- you use the HTML attribute directly in the element
 embedded styles- you need to create style elements in the head section of your doc
 external stylesheet- you need to use the link element to link the current doc to the external stylesheet

 css selectors
 element we use the tag name
 ID this one is for unique elements on a page
 class. this one is for elements with similar visual presentation
 these selectors have a specific priority order they must follow

 pseudo classes
 they represent state on an element. for instance the states of a link (anchor tags)


 properties

 test properties
 font properties
    * serif
    *sans-serif
    *monospace
 background properties
 list properties


 box properties

  everything is a box in a page
  that defines the position  of the elements on a page
  space, size
    width, padding, border = all factor in the size of the element
    total width = width + padding + padding
    total height = height + padding + border

    margin

for web use 65% for words of page or else its hard to read for the user
in order to to show your content properly on different platforms use the metadata viewport
you will be using different stylesheets if you plan for your conent to be used in different platforms
these stylesheets are called conditional stylesheet
depending on your parameters set you can display completely different content from other stylesheets
{if blank then blank} (CONDITIONALS)
be weary of how many sheets you use the more stylesheets you use the longer your  page will take to load

alternatively you can use a @media rule negating the use of various stylesheets
you will still need a viewport inorder to display css properly
